# Generating Swipeable Tinder Profiles using AI: Adversarial & Recurrent Neural Networks in Realistic Content Generation

An implementation of StyleGAN and RNN architectures to generate profile biographical and image information, with the aim of generating believable female profiles as a proof of concept. All notebooks were ran in Google's Colaboratory environment with GPU acceleration enabled.

* StyleGAN pre-trained on FFHQ 1024x1024 dataset, cloned from NVIDIA's StyleGAN repository
* RNN trained on Kaggle Wine Reviews Dataset. Based upon the TrumpChar RNN project, with input from Brownlee's excellent RNN tutorials.
* RNN trained on the now-deleted Kaggle Tinder Female Profiles dataset. Legacy attempt kept for reference purposes, without access to dataset.
