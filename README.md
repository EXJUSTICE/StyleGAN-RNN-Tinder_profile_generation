# Generating Swipeable Tinder Profiles using AI: Adversarial & Recurrent Neural Networks in Realistic Content Generation

An implementation of StyleGAN and RNN architectures to generate profile biographical and image information, with the aim of generating believable female profiles as a proof of concept. All notebooks were ran in Google's Colaboratory environment with GPU acceleration enabled.

StyleGAN pre-trained on FFHQ 1024x1024 dataset, cloned from NVIDIA's StyleGAN repository
RNN trained on Kaggle Tinder Female Profiles dataset. Based upon the TrumpChar RNN project, with input from Brownlee's excellent RNN tutorials.
