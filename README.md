# Generating Swipeable Tinder Profiles using AI: Adversarial & Recurrent Neural Networks in Realistic Content Generation

An implementation of StyleGAN and RNN architectures to generate profile biographical and image information, with the aim of generating believable female profiles as a proof of concept.

StyleGAN pre-trained on FFHQ 1024x1024 dataset.
RNN trained on Kaggle Tinder Female Profiles dataset.
